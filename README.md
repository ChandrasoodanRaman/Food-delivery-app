# Food Delivery App

A user-friendly food delivery web application where customers can browse food items, add items to their cart, and place an order with delivery details. This project is built with **React** and **React Router** and uses **Context API** for state management.

## Features

- **User Login**: Modal-based login option, allowing quick user authentication.
- **Navigation**: A responsive and intuitive navigation bar.
- **Cart Management**: Add, view, and adjust items in the shopping cart.
- **Order Placement**: Easy-to-fill order form for delivery details.
- **Total Calculation**: Dynamic calculation of cart subtotal, delivery fee, and total order amount.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Project Overview

This app provides a seamless flow from product browsing to checkout:

1. **Home Page**: Displays available food items.
2. **Cart Page**: Shows selected items, allowing users to adjust quantities or remove items.
3. **Order Page**: Collects user information for delivery, with dynamic calculations for cart totals.
4. **Footer**: Contains additional information and links.

The app uses `React Context` to share the cart state globally, making it easy to update quantities and calculate totals in real-time.
